This project focus on predicting the risk of cervical cancer affection. The cervical cancer research data collected by “Hospital Universitario de Caracas” was used to establish a decision tree model to predict the four screening indicators for cervical cancer. The subsampled method was applied to improve the model’s performance. It turns out that women with more pregnancies, older age, and younger age for first intercourse are at greater risk of cervical cancer. Note that the prediction accuracy rate of Biopsy on the test set achieves to 99.3%.
